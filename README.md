# Amoura
A minecraft modpack containing Pixelmon and a few other QoL mods that enhance the Pixelmon experience

I own none of these mods, I have simply compiled them and distributed them in a mod pack. Please support the original authors of these mods! Additionally, this server is optimized for a more Pixelmon heavy challenge than a Minecraft heavy one. The general consensus on the server has been no PVP and there is no hostile mob spawning (for the most part). Also, you keep inventory on death. As such, please be respectful to everyone playing and try not to be needlessly destructive. There is a land permissions mod installed, so ask me (WindexTheGr8) or another mod that is online for help if you need it. Other than that, happy Pixelmoning!

Welcome to Amoura region! I hope you enjoy your time here! If you are not familiar with CURSE FORGE for managing and launching minecraft mods,
the first thing you are going to want to do is install curse forge and set up minecraft within it. It should auto-detect your minecraft install,
but you may have to either tell it where it is or reinstall it using CURSE FORGE. Also, you will need the modpack here:

For those who prefer NOT to use CURSE FORGE, I will also include a link to the mods and resource packs:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gZvWmQ8m6yHcZQCgoVNded65oP54E6tv?usp=sharing

Once in the minecraft section of CURSE FORGE, you're going to want to click the button at the top right that says "Create Custom Profile".
This will bring up a little window that will allow you to create your own profile, but instead you're going to want to click on the underlined
"import" near the top of the window. This will bring up your file system. From here, you will just need to locate the Amoura_1.1.zip whereever you 
saved it on your computer and CURSE FORGE should do the rest. The server IP is preinstalled in the modpack!

A few problems I anticipate will be covered below:

Q: why can't I throw out my Pokemon/fight other Pokemon?

A: for whatever reason there is a controls discrepency that prevents you from throwing out your Pokemon with default controls. To remedy this, just
go into your controls menu, search for "r" and click the box next to "key". This will pull up all of your keybinds that use the "r" key. Either rebind
your send/retrive Pokemon key, or rebind the two keys that are conflicting (I put mine on my numpad). I'd take some time to familiarize yourself with
the Pixelmon controls as well while you are here.

Q: why can't I see pokemon on my minimap?

A: you may not ask this, but it's a game changer because shinies show up shiny on the minimap as well. To fix this, just press "J", then go to your 
options. Under "Minimap Preset 1" you can scroll down to "Mob Display" and change that to "Large Icons". Additionally, I'd change your map to a square
because circles are lame. Rectangle is also acceptable. As a last side note, you can use the "-" and "+" keys to zoom in and out while you are in game.

Q: What are all of these annoying boxes that keep showing up whenever I look at something? And for that matter, what's up with these coordinates under my crosshair? This is an outrage modpack=unplayable!

A: That is a mod that I like to use called HWYLA which just tells you what you are looking at. The settings for this are completely configurable in mod options and it has Pixelmon integration so I thought I'd include it. To get rid of all the boxes with info about blocks and Pokemon, just diable HWYLA and Waila Harvestability in your mod options. The coordinates under the crosshair are a chunk measurer that comes enable by deafult with the WorldEdit CUI. You can either assign a button in controls to toggle this (and then toggle it) or just disable WorldEdit CUI 3 altogether which is what I would do if I were you.

Q: I did everything manually and I don't have the server IP. What do?

A: The server IP is 167.114.100.203 and the name of the Region is Amoura :)
