# Amoura
A minecraft modpack containing Pixelmon and a few other QoL mods that enhance the Pixelmon experience

I own none of these mods, I have simply compiled them and distributed them in a mod pack. Please support the original authors of these mods!

Welcome to Amoura region! I hope you enjoy your time here! If you are not familiar with CURSE FORGE for managing and launching minecraft mods,
the first thing you are going to want to do is install curse forge and set up minecraft within it. It should auto-detect your minecraft install,
but you may have to either tell it where it is or reinstall it using CURSE FORGE. Also, you will need the modpack here:

https://github.com/napkinz77/Amoura/raw/af1407e57d7b582548cb8a63cc3174e86a42c2aa/Amoura_1.1.zip

Once in the minecraft section of CURSE FORGE, you're going to want to click the button at the top right that says "Create Custom Profile".
This will bring up a little window that will allow you to create your own profile, but instead you're going to want to click on the underlined
"import" near the top of the window. This will bring up your file system. From here, you will just need to locate the Amoura_1.1.zip whereever you 
saved it on your computer and CURSE FORGE should do the rest. The server IP is preinstalled in the modpack!

A few problems I anticipate will be covered below:

Q: why can't I throw out my Pokemon/fight other Pokemon?

A: for whatever reason there is a controls discrepency that prevents you from throwing out your Pokemon with default controls. To remedy this, just
go into your controls menu, search for "r" and click the box next to "key". This will pull up all of your keybinds that use the "r" key. Either rebind
your send/retrive Pokemon key, or rebind the two keys that are conflicting (I put mine on my numpad). I'd take some time to familiarize yourself with
the Pixelmon controls as well while you are here.

Q: why can't I see pokemon on my minimap?

A: you may not ask this, but it's a game changer because shinies show up shiny on the minimap as well. To fix this, just press "J", then go to your 
options. Under "Minimap Preset 1" you can scroll down to "Mob Display" and change that to "Large Icons". Additionally, I'd change your map to a square
because circles are lame. Rectangle is also acceptable. As a last side note, you can use the "-" and "+" keys to zoom in and out while you are in game.
